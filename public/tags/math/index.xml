      <title>Probability in CS Notes</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are my notes for my introductory course in probability theory and its applications to computer science. Note this&#xA;is from my first course in probability, so the mathematical rigor is&amp;hellip;well it&amp;rsquo;s lacking. But I am taking/have taken a&#xA;formal course in probability theory and my notes will be/are available under &amp;ldquo;probability theory notes&amp;rdquo;. This course was&#xA;primarily application focused and as such the notes remain somewhat bare-bones. I have tried to supplement them with&#xA;examples(hopefully) that illustrate what the course focused on. I found that the variety and creativity of the&#xA;problems that were designed for the course was the real value which was offered to me as a student.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Real-Analysis Notes</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are my notes for my course in real-analysis. The course textbook was Ross-Elementary Analysis. The course covered&#xA;up until uniform convergence and the Weierstrass M-test. I supplemented some of the gaps in content with&#xA;Stephen Abbott&amp;rsquo;s Understanding Analysis textbook for concepts such as measure and point-set topology etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;chapter-1-the-real-numbers&#34;&gt;Chapter 1: The Real Numbers&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;quick-overview&#34;&gt;Quick Overview&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Analysis begins with a rigorous construction of the number systems we use. While Calculus relies on computational rules, Analysis relies on the axiomatic properties of the set of real numbers, denoted $\mathbf{R}$. This chapter builds $\mathbf{R}$ from the ground up, starting with the natural numbers ($\mathbf{N}$) and moving through the field and order axioms, culminating in the Completeness Axiom—the property that distinguishes $\mathbf{R}$ from the rational numbers ($\mathbf{Q}$) and allows for the existence of limits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Infection Model</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;absorbing-markov-chain-infection-model&#34;&gt;Absorbing Markov Chain Infection Model&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A little introduction to stochastic processes through an infection model.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this project I considered a situation in which there are two people in a room, one sick and one healthy, where the&#xA;objective was to estimate the probability that the healthy person would become sick after some amount of time spent in&#xA;the room. A few key assumptions were made when designing this problem: a) these individuals perform random walks in this&#xA;room, b) the room is rectangular(can be represented spatially with a matrix), c) the probability of getting sick at any moment&#xA;can be represented in terms of the distance between the sick and healthy person. The general idea of this project was to&#xA;use my knowledge of probability and linear algebra to break down a seemingly difficult problem into one that could be&#xA;solved quite easily with some clever tricks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;lecture-notes&#34;&gt;Lecture notes&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here I will ramble about my brief course in introductory CS :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;week-1&#34;&gt;Week 1&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;broad-basics-of-computer-science&#34;&gt;Broad Basics of Computer Science:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A computer program is a collection of code for the computer to run.&#xA;The code in a program is divided into smaller, logical units of code called functions,&#xA;much as all the words that make up an essay are divided into logical paragraphs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;python-syntax&#34;&gt;Python Syntax:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In python functions are made by writing def function_name (parameter1, parameter2,&amp;hellip; parameter n).&#xA;The function is called by writing function_name(parameters).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Linear Algebra Notes</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;chapter-notes&#34;&gt;Chapter Notes&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;quick-overview&#34;&gt;Quick Overview&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given that this is linear algebra, I will be focusing on linear subspaces, which can be defined as the span, or the&#xA;amount of space covered by, a finite collection of vectors. These subspaces will lie in $\mathbf{R}^n$, or the space of&#xA;all n-dimensional vectors(with n coordinates). Linear subspaces will be represented by $\mathsf{V}$. The n-tuples of&#xA;vectors which define these subspaces will be represented by the following:&#xA;$\vec{v}_n=\begin{bmatrix}&#xA;\vec{v}_1 \\&#xA;\vdots \\&#xA;\vec{v}_n&#xA;\end{bmatrix}$&lt;/p&gt;</description>
