## about

Hi, I'm Max. I'm a Stanford sophomore studying Math with a Statistics co-term, drawn to the challenge of using rigorous
analytical thinking to tackle complex problems. What excites me most is finding the underlying patterns and logic in
messy, real-world situations, whether that's through mathematical proofs, statistical modeling, or data analysis. I'm
genuinely curious about how quantitative methods can create meaningful impact across different fields, from healthcare
to AI and beyond. Through my coursework and projects, I've developed skills in mathematical
reasoning, statistical analysis, and programming, but my true passion lies in making cool things with others and applying
these tools to solve problems that actually matter.
