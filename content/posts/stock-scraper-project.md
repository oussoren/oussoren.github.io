# Stock Info Scraper

A Python tool I developed for scraping and analyzing stock market data.

## Overview

I built this project to automate and collect stock information and perform stock analysis to speed up the process of analyzing
stocks for investment. In future versions I hope to add sector comparisons to provide more valuable information such as
how the stock is performing relative to the rest of the sector and if it seems to be over/under-valued.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Scrapes real-time stock information from various sources
- **Analysis Tools**: Processes and analyzes collected data
- **Reporting**: Generates automated reports and insights

## Implementation

The scraper is built using Python and uses libraries such as yfinance, pandas, etc. for web scraping and data analysis.

## Source Code

Check out the implementation in my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/oussoren/oussoren.github.io/tree/main/stock-scraper).
